Connect to Sequencing.com for iOS Swift has been integrated into the codebase for Sequencing.com's Real-Time Personalization (+RTP) API. 

You can use the Connect to Sequencing.com functionality alone (i.e. if you don't have to use any other parts of the +RTP API) or in-combination with all of the other cool functionality enabled by this API.
